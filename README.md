# Makefiles-Advanced

Created a makefile that creates bash scripts and other executable files by things such as replacing letters in certain files and concatenating files together. In the end, it produces four executable files which when run, display different messages.

To run: Download files onto your computer and via command line type make -f makefile1 all

To clean: make -f makefile1 clean
